# JellySin Plugin Repository

One plugin repository for JellySin's independent Jellyfin 12 plugins. Add this URL
in Jellyfin's plugin repository settings:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jellysin/repo/main/manifest.json
```

The plugin repository is empty. [JellySin Last.fm](https://github.com/jellysin/plugin-lastfm)
is in development; its premature 1.0.0 release has been withdrawn. No plugin
release is currently approved for installation from this plugin repository.

## Publication

An allowlist binds each plugin GUID to one public source repository and the
approved `.github/workflows/release.yml`. When enabled, the updater is configured
for minutes 17 and 47 each hour and supports manual dispatch. GitHub scheduled
runs can be delayed; this is a polling interval, not a publication latency guarantee.

Pinned shared tooling verifies the actual GitHub-signed provenance of all four
release artifacts against the repository, workflow, commit and tag. Releases must
be immutable. The ZIP's SHA-256, Jellyfin MD5, size, member paths, permissions,
file allowlist and CRC are checked before any plugin repository file changes.

The updater opens a PR using only this repository's GITHUB_TOKEN and explicitly
dispatches CI on its branch. Required checks and normal PR review/merge behavior
apply. Plugin source repositories have no write access here, and no release App
or personal access token is needed.

## Adding a plugin

Submit a PR adding a unique GUID, repository, and approved workflow to `plugins.json`.
Review the source repository and publication workflow before adding that trust.
The source must use the release metadata contract in
[release-helper](https://github.com/jellysin/release-helper). The Last.fm descriptor
is the first allowlisted plugin; no Last.fm-specific behavior exists in the updater.

Existing versions are immutable plugin repository history. Do not replace checksums, edit
download URLs, or remove old compatible versions to repair an upload. Publish a
new version instead. A failed verification leaves the entire plugin repository unchanged.

EUPL-1.2 covers this repository's source and documentation. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
